# README #

This repository contains python scripts. These scripts use:
* Pygame for 2D image visualizations.
* Numpy and PyLab for Graph visualizations and random distributions.

Cellular automata models are bound with Epidemic models like:
* SIS (Susceptible Infected Susceptible)
* SEIR (Susceptible Exposed Infected Recovered)
* etc...

These scripts are a "quick-to-test" precursor to the EpidemicSimulator project.
